Rai Sato (佐藤 来) is an internship student at [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/), Japan (September 2021 -). I am also working on [GATARI Inc.](https://gatari.co.jp/) as a product engineer.

My research focuses on the temporal synchrony between vibrotactile and auditory, and the interactive auditory training using biosignals such as an electroencephalogram (EEG). I also have technical skills in music recording and audio engineering, especially 5.1 ch surround system, and more immersive sound technologies such as Ambisonics and 22.2 ch multi channel audio system.
