Rai Sato (佐藤 来) is a lab technician at [Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.oist.jp/), Japan (May 2022 -).

My research objective is to provide a method to enhance user experience in the Metaverse through a novel rendering of immersive multisensory information based on an understanding of the auditory perception in extended realities (XRs).

XRs are real-and-virtual hybrid environments enabling human-machine interactions through advanced computer technology and wearables. As a new style of social connection with XRs, the Metaverse offers new possibilities for all aspects of our lives, not only entertainment and digital arts. To realize such possibilities, we need to understand a cognitive model of how we intricately select and interpret multisensory information in the real world, and utilize the model to provide the Metaverse users with immersive and augmentative content. However, its technologies and research tend to focus on the visual experience, although we perceive the real world through multisensory including audition. Techniques for properly creating realistic audio and associated somatic sensations are essential for convincing virtual-spatial experiences. Interaction with sounds that change continuously with sensory environmental cues reinforces a sense of “being there.” Such continuous and seamless interactivity shall enhance the plausibility of XR’s experiences and the shared sense of multiple participants in the Metaverse.

Specifically, I am currently focusing on these research themes;
- Multimodal synchrony perception between auditory and vibrotactile
- Real-time spatial sound rendering system for auditory augmented reality
- Sensory Substitution device
- Relation between brain activities and selective attention

See this page for detailed overviews of these research themes.
