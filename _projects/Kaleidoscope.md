I exhibited a VR works at a campus festival on the University of Tokyo. (https://www.gogatsusai.jp/kikaku/487)
[Kaleidoscope ver.2]
This work is an experience-based attraction with Head Mounted Display, 3rd order Ambisonics and Whole-body Vibration, which story was inspired by a short SF story, ”Kaleidoscope” by Ray Bradbury.
The video are made by Unity, and the Music and Vibration are controlled by MaxMsp. (The HOA decording are by ircam spat.)
Start and stop signals of the music and the direction of HMD are transmitted from Unity to MaxMsp with OSC. The music of a 3rd order ambisonics are mixed using IEM plug-in suite and Reaper.
